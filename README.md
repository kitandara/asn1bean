# ASN1bean
Fork of ASN Bean, updates the compiler to add generation of GoLang classes/structs and methods.
The generated classes can then be used together with the ASN1BER Go libraries to efficiently encode and decode messages using the Basic Encoding Rules (BER). 
The encoded bytes also conform to the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) which is a subset of BER.
